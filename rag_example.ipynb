That I work less than four hours per week and make \\nmore per month than I used to make in a year? \\nFor the first time, I\\'m going to tell you the real story. It involves a \\nquiet subculture of people called the \"New Rich.\" \\nWhat does an igloo-dwelling millionaire do that a cubicle-dweller \\ndoesn\\'t? Follow an uncommon set of rules. \\nHow does a lifelong blue-chip employee escape to travel the \\nworld for a month without his boss even noticing? He uses tech-\\nnology to hide the fact. \\nGold is getting old.

It begins with a simple distinction most people miss—one I \\nmissed for 25 years. \\nPeople don\\'t want to be millionaires—they want to experience \\nwhat they believe only millions can buy.

Sounds nice. \\n$1,000,000 in the bank isn\\'t the fantasy. The fantasy is the life-\\nstyle of complete freedom it supposedly allows. The question is then, \\nHow can one achieve the millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom \\nwithoutfirst having $1,000,000? \\nIn the last five years, I have answered this question for myself, \\nand this book will answer it for you. I will show you exactly how I \\nhave separated income from time and created my ideal lifestyle in the \\nprocess, traveling the world and enjoying the best this planet has to \\noffer.

Retirement Is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance. \\nRetirement planning is like life insurance. It should be viewed as \\nnothing more than a hedge against the absolute worst-case sce-\\nnario: in this case, becoming physically incapable of working and \\nneeding a reservoir of capital to survive. \\nRetirement as a goal or final redemption is flawed for at least \\nthree solid reasons: \\na. It is predicated on the assumption that you dislike what you \\nare doing during the most physically capable years of your life. \\nThis is a nonstarter—nothing can justify that sacrifice.  \\nb. Most people will never be able to retire and maintain even a \\nhotdogs-for-dinner standard of living. Even one million is \\nchump change in a world where traditional retirement could \\nspan 30 years and inflation lowers your purchasing power 2-4% \\nper year. The math doesn\\'t work. 4 The golden years become \\nlower-middle-class life revisited. That\\'s a bittersweet ending. \\nc. If the math does work, it means that you are one ambitious, \\nhardworking machine. If that\\'s the case, guess what? One \\nweek into retirement, you\\'ll be so damn bored that you\\'ll want \\nto stick bicycle spokes in your eyes. You\\'ll probably opt to look \\nfor a new job or start another company. Kinda defeats the \\npurpose of waiting, doesn\\'t it? \\n4. \"Living Well\" (Barron\\'s, March 20, 2006, Suzanne McGee).

Interest and Energy Are Cyclical. \\nIf I offered you $10,000,000 to work 24 hours a day for 15 years \\nand then retire, would you do it? Of course not—you couldn\\'t. It \\nis unsustainable, just as what most define as a career: doing the \\nsame thing for 8+ hours per day until you break down or have \\nenough cash to permanently stop. \\nHow else can my 30-year-old friends all look like a cross \\nbetween Donald Trump and Joan Rivers?

Capacity, interest, and mental endurance all wax \\nand wane. Plan accordingly. \\nThe NR aims to distribute \"mini-retirements\" throughout life \\ninstead of hoarding the recovery and enjoyment for the fool\\'s gold \\nof retirement. By working only when you are most effective, life \\nis both more productive and more enjoyable. It\\'s the perfect \\nexample of having your cake and eating it, too. \\nPersonally, I now aim for one month of overseas relocation or \\nhigh-intensity learning (tango, fighting, whatever) for every two \\nmonths of work projects. \\n3. Less Is Not Laziness. \\nDoing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of \\ngreater personal importance, is NOT laziness.

Money Alone Is Not the Solution. \\nThere is much to be said for the power of money as currency (I\\'m \\na fan myself), but adding more of it just isn\\'t the answer as often \\nas we\\'d like to think. In part, it\\'s laziness. \"If only I had more \\nmoney\" is the easiest way to postpone the intense self-\\nexamination and decision-making necessary to create a life of \\nenjoyment—now and not later.

Chap A moving at \\n80 hours per week and Chap B moving at 10 hours per week. \\nThey both make $50,000 per year. Who will be richer when they \\npass in the middle of the night? If you said B, you would be cor-\\nrect, and this is the difference between absolute and relative \\nincome. \\nAbsolute income is measured using one holy and inalterable \\nvariable: the raw and almighty dollar. Jane Doe makes $100,000 \\nper year and is thus twice as rich as John Doe, who makes \\n$50,000 per year. \\nRelative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usu-\\nally hours. The whole \"per year\" concept is arbitrary and makes it \\neasy to trick yourself. Let\\'s look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes \\n$100,000 per year, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and \\nworks 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per hour. \\nJohn Doe makes $50,000 per year, $1,000 for each of 50 weeks \\nper year, but works 10 hours per week and hence makes $100 per \\nhour. In relative income, John is four times richer. \\nOf course, relative income has to add up to the minimum \\namount necessary to actualize your goals.

Destructive criticism, abusive bosses, \\nand smashing your face on a curb are examples of this. These are \\nthings we want to avoid. \\nEustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably \\nnever heard.

It\\'s destructive criticism \\nwe need to avoid, not criticism in all forms.

Here are four simple tips \\nthat will lessen the damage and increase your speed at least 200% in 10 minutes \\nwith no comprehension loss: \\n1. Two Minutes: Use a pen or finger to trace under each line as you \\nread as fast as possible. Reading is a series of jumping snapshots (called \\nsaccades), and using a visual guide prevents regression. \\n2. Three Minutes: Begin each line focusing on the third word in from \\nthe first word, and end each line focusing on the third word in from the \\nlast word. This makes use of peripheral vision that is otherwise wasted on \\nmargins. For example, even when the highlighted words in the next line are \\nyour beginning and ending focal points, the entire sentence is \"read,\" just \\nwith less eye movement: \\n\"Once upon a time, an information addict decided to detox.\" \\nMove in from both sides further and further as it gets easier. \\nT ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='8be7d1be-eff6-4e7a-a431-9a2a6b4fe929', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '99', 'file_name': 'omp.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/hammad/Documents/7th Semester/CS455-NLPwithDL/data/omp.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1743757, 'creation_date': '2024-11-29', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='86 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION \\n3. Two Minutes: Once comfortable indenting three or four words from \\nboth sides, attempt to take only two snapshots—also known as \\nfixations—per line on the first and last indented words. \\n4. Three Minutes: Practice reading too fast for comprehension but \\nwith good technique (the above three techniques) for five pages prior \\nto reading at a comfortable speed. This will heighten perception and reset \\nyour speed limit, much like how 50 mph normally feels fast but seems like \\nslow motion if you drop down from 70 mph on the freeway. \\nTo calculate reading speed in words per minute (wpm)—and thus progress—\\nin a given book, add up the number of words in ten lines and divide by ten to get \\nthe average words per line.

Estimate the amount of time you will save by grouping similar \\ntasks together and batching them, and calculate how much you \\nhave earned by multiplying this hour number by your per-hour \\nrate ($20 here): \\n1 x per week: 10 hours = $200 \\n1 x per two weeks:    20 hours = $400 \\n1 x per month: 40 hours = $800 \\n3.

If the cost is less \\nthan the above dollar amounts, batch even further apart. \\nFor example, using our above math, if I check e-mail once per \\nweek and that results in an average loss of two sales per week, to-\\ntaling $80 in lost profit, I will continue checking once per week \\nbecause $200 (10 hours of time) minus $80 is still a $120 net \\ngain, not to mention the enormous benefits of completing other \\nmain tasks in those 10 hours.

These are Doug's prod-\\nucts, but he doesn't own them, as that would require physical inven-\\ntory and upfront cash. His business model is more elegant than that. \\nHere is just one revenue stream: \\n1. A prospective customer sees his Pay-Per-Click (PPC) adver-\\ntising on Google or other search engines and clicks through to his \\nsite, www.prosoundeffects.com. \\n2. The prospect orders a product for $325 (the average purchase \\nprice, though prices range from $29-7,500) on a Yahoo shopping \\ncart, and a PDF with all their billing and shipping information is \\nautomatically e-mailed to Doug. \\n3. Three times a week, Doug presses a single button in the \\nYahoo management page to charge all his customers' credit cards \\nand put cash in his bank account. Then he saves the PDFs as \\nExcel purchase orders and e-mails the purchase orders to the \\nmanufacturers of the CD libraries. Those companies mail the \\nproducts to Doug's customers—this is called drop-shipping— and \\nDoug pays the manufacturers as little as 45% of the retail price of \\nthe products up to 90 days later (net-90 terms). \\nLet's look at the mathematical beauty of his system for full effect. \\nFor each $325 order at his cost of 55% off retail, Doug is entitled \\nto $178.75. If we subtract 1% of the full retail price (1% of $325 = \\n$3.25) for the Yahoo Store transaction fee and 2.5% for the credit \\ncard processing fee (2.5% of $325 = $8.13), Doug is left with a pre-\\ntax profit of $167.38 for this one sale. \\nMultiply this by 10 and we have $1673.80 in profit for 30 min-\\nutes of work.

How did he test the \\nidea and go from $o to $10,000 per month in the process? He \\nfollowed these steps. \\n1. Market Selection \\nHe chose music and television producers as his market because \\nhe is a musician himself and has used these products. \\n2. Product Brainstorm \\nHe chose the most popular products available for resale from the \\nlargest manufacturers of sound libraries and arranged a wholesale \\npurchase and drop-ship agreement with them. Many of these \\nlibraries cost well above $300 (up to $7,500), and this is precisely \\nwhy he needs to answer more customer-service questions than \\nsomeone with a lower-priced product of $50-200. \\n3. Micro-Testing \\nHe auctioned the products on eBay to test demand (and the \\nhighest possible pricing) before purchasing inventory. He ordered \\nproduct only when people placed orders from him, and product \\nshipped immediately from the manufacturers' warehouses. Based \\non this demand confirmed on eBay, Doug created a Yahoo Store \\nwith these products and began testing Google Adwords and other \\nPPC search engines. \\n4. Rollout and Automation \\nFollowing this testing, and upon generating sufficient cash flow, \\nDoug began experimenting with print advertising in trade maga-\\nzines. Simultaneously, he streamlined and outsourced operations \\nto reduce his time requirements from two hours per day to two \\nhours per week. \\nR \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='347ae20a-4773-491a-9f52-a099b14aec11', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '190', 'file_name': 'omp.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/hammad/Documents/7th Semester/CS455-NLPwithDL/data/omp.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1743757, 'creation_date': '2024-11-29', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Income Autopilot II 177 \\n-COMFORT CHALLENGE \\nRejecting First Offers and Walking Away (3 Days) \\nBefore performing this exercise, if possible, read the bonus chapter \\n\"How to Get $700,000 of Advertising for $10,000\" on our com-\\npanion site, and then set aside two hours on a consecutive Saturday, \\nSunday, and Monday. \\nOn Saturday and Sunday, go to a farmers\\' market or other outdoor \\nevent where goods are sold.

For negotiation purposes as well, remember that it is \\nbest not to appear to be the ultimate decision-maker. \\n2. Put multiple e-mail and phone contacts on the website. \\nPut various e-mail addresses on the \"contact us\" page for different \\ndepartments, such as \"human resources,\" \"sales,\" \"general inquiries,\" \\n\"wholesale distribution,\" \"media/PR,\" \"investors,\" \"Web comments,\" \"order \\nstatus,\" and so on.

      "\n",
      "1. Outsourcing: He discovered the power of outsourcing tasks to virtual assistants (VAs) in the Philippines. This allowed him to focus on the high-level tasks that only he could do, while the VAs handled the administrative and customer service tasks.\n",
      "2. Automation: He automated as many processes as possible, such as setting up an autoresponder for email inquiries and creating a sales funnel for his product.\n",
      "3. Delegation: He learned to delegate tasks to others, even if it meant paying for it. He realized that his time was worth more than the cost of outsourcing.\n",
      "4. Focusing on the core business: He learned to focus on the core business and outsource or automate everything else. This allowed him to scale the business without having to work more hours.\n",
      "5. Creating a product: He learned that creating a product was the most efficient way to build a business. He could sell the product to multiple customers, whereas consulting or coaching services only allowed him to work with one client at a time.\n",
