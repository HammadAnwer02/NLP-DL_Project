NLP-DL Library Chatbot 🚀

Welcome to the NLP-DL Library Chatbot project! This repository contains the implementation of an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students in navigating and retrieving contextual information from a university’s online library. Using state-of-the-art NLP and deep learning techniques, we provide an intuitive and effective way to access knowledge from a vast collection of books.

Overview 📝

The NLP-DL Library Chatbot combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide contextually accurate responses to user prompts. By leveraging the Groq API and advanced NLP techniques, the chatbot accesses and retrieves information specific to the university library’s vast digital collection, ensuring students receive precise and relevant answers.

Features ✨
	•	Contextual Question Answering: Responds to library-related queries with relevant and accurate information.
	•	Book Retrieval: Scans the library database to provide detailed information about books, authors, and topics.
	•	Dynamic RAG Integration: Combines retrieval and generation capabilities for enhanced performance.
	•	Scalable Design: Built for seamless integration and scalability.

Technologies Used 🛠️
	•	Python 3.9+: Used for running the RAG Model and connecting to the LLM.
	•	Selenium: For web scraping and library data extraction.
	•	Hugging Face Transformers: Pre-trained models for RAG and NLP tasks.
	•	Groq API: Provides LLM capabilities.
	•	Streamlit: Front-end UI for chatbot communication.
	

Setup Instructions 🔧

Prerequisites:
	•	Python 3.9 or higher with requirement libraries installed
	•	ChromeDriver (for Selenium)
	•	Streamlit
    •	Groq API Key
    


Steps:
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/HammadAnwer02/NLP-DL_Project.git
cd NLP-DL_Project


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file and include your GROQ API keys:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key


	4.	Run the application:

streamlit run frontend.py


	5.	Open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:8501/ # Or whatever URL is provided from Streamlit

Usage 💻
	1.	Enter your query into the chatbot interface.
	2.	The bot retrieves relevant information using the library’s database and responds.
	3.	Review the results and refine your query if necessary.
